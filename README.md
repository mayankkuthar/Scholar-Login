### Project Description -
The project "Real-Time Scholarship Verification System" addresses the critical inefficiencies in the existing scholarship application and verification process. The conventional methods of manual data entry, sluggish verification, and lack of instant feedback lead to delays and uncertainty. To revolutionize this landscape, our project introduces automation through Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology, real-time integration with external databases, and a user-centric interface. By doing so, we aim to streamline the verification process, enhance accuracy, and provide applicants with immediate feedback on their application status. This project aligns with the modern need for efficiency, transparency, and equitable access to educational opportunities.
